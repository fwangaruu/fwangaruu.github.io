									<h1>Project Three<br />
									3D Printing Journey</h1>
									<p>This project showcases the process designing and remixing my 3D prints using two softwares, Tinkercad and Fusion.</p>

								<h2>Project Overview</h2>
								<p>For Project 3, I was introduced to the fundamentals of electronics prototyping through soldering and assembling a not working radio kit. This was my first time working with electronic components, and I slightly learned how resistors, capacitors, and transistors work together to complete a circuit. The soldering process was both challenging and fun. Seeing how close and steady you need to be when soldering allowed me to gain a new appreciation for solders. After several attempts, I successfully assembled the radio however, I was not able to power it. But this was not the goal of the project.</p>
								
								<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>3D Printer: Prusa Mini</li>
									<li>Design Software: Fusion & Tinkercad</li>
									<li>Laser cutting</li>
									<li>Slicing Software: PrusaSlicer</li>
									<li>Materials: PLA.</li>
								</ul>

										<h3>Design Phase</h3>
										<p>Once the radio was built, I began the main part of the project, designing and constructing a custom 3D-printed enclosure for the radio. My initial base model was created in Fusion 360, but I encountered a few issues with software and continued to deal with the learning curve. To simplify the design process, I transferred my work to TinkerCad, where I continued the design process and adjusted for the measurements of the radio. After many tries, I learned that dimensions and scaling don’t always translate consistently between different software programs, which led to some misalignments in my prototype.
This project showed me how remixing an existing model can still be a creative process and that you still need attention to details, especially when adjusting features to add more functionality. By adding drainage holes and filling in others, I made the pot better for small succulents. In the end, the modified flower pot worked well for its purpose, and the process taught me how small changes in design can have a big impact on usability.

										<h3>Polaroid Holder</h3>
										<p>Throughout the process, I went through six different prototype iterations in TinkerCad, each time adjusting wall thickness, tolerance, and internal spacing to improve the fit of the radio components. Some of the early prints had warping issues or lids that didn’t fully close due to the incorrect amount of tolerances. With guidance from professor Krones, and classmates, I returned to Fusion 360 to finalize a more precise version of the enclosure. Working in Fusion allowed me to better control measurements, align parts accurately, and design more structurally sound walls and edges. While this version solved the earlier warping issues, the tolerance was still slightly off, as shown in picture XXX.
											The final step of the project was to recreate the enclosure using the laser cutter, which would allow for cleaner edges and better dimensional accuracy. Although I was not able to complete that portion before the project deadline, my plan is to continue refining my design and experiment with laser cutting.

								<h2>Results & Learnings</h2>
								<p>Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>3D modeling and design principles</li>
									<li>Print settings optimization</li>
									<li>Material properties and selection</li>
									<li>Post-processing techniques</li>
									<li>Troubleshooting common printing issues</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
								<p>Overall, this project taught me a great deal about integrating electronics with digital fabrication. I learned how critical measurement accuracy is when transitioning between different design platforms, how tolerances affect print quality and fit, and how to iterate on prototypes to solve design issues. It also allowed me to learn how hardware design must be very accurate in order to create a functional and well-finished product.</p>
