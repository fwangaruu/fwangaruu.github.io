									<h1>Scavenger Hunt<br />

								<div class="scavenger-grid">
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/Bathroom.jpg" alt="Evidence of design for navigation without one or more of the 5 senses" /> </div>
										<p>While walking through the SCC near the classroom, my partner and I found oursleves looking for the bathroom.
											We saw that the bathroom had a sign high near the cieling to indicate that this was where the bathroom is.
											The placement of the sign shows design to help people without hearing as one of their senses.
										</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/Elevator.jpg" alt="Evidence of design for forms of assistance, broadly defined" /></div>
										<p>Later my parnter and I walked through Sherman dining hall, where there is an elevator that provides assistance
											to those who are not able to walk up or down the stairs.
										</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/Lift.jpg" alt="Evidence of design for aging, broadly defined" /></div>
										<p>During our walk around campus, Brandeis was getting ready for their annual Family Weekend. During our walk
											we witnessed a Brandies staff member helping an eldery person move around campus easily and quickly.
										</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/Gym.jpg" alt="Evidence of design for young children" /></div>
										<p>This is Brandeis gym, Gosman Sports and Convocation Center. Sometimes during the school year, the gym is used for middle school
											and elementary student for their club basketball or soccer game. 
										</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/Sidewalk.jpg" alt="Evidence of design for wheeled mobile gear" /></div>
										<p>Our walk around campus, lead us to the Rose Art Musuem, where we saw a sidewalk that is easily accessable with people with wheeled mobile gear.
											The sidewalk started at the road and allowed the person to get to the musuem with their gear.
										</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/balconey.jpg" alt="Evidence of design with physical barriers" /></div>
										<p>My partner and I, ended up walking to Brandeis' theater where shows are usually preformed. During our time in the theater, we spoke with the equipment manager,
											and during our conversation he pointed us to the balconey. We were told that there are a lot of physical barriers up there becasue,
											of how small it was and that getting up there was only accessable to people who are able to do so.
										</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/Unknown.jpg" alt="Evidence of design with a lack of information" /></div>
										<p>Behind the Rose Art Musuem, there was this structure that my partner and I came across. This structure was fully made out of wood
											and was very old. This structure had no writing on it or near it to describe what it was. After examining it for a few minutes with my partner,
											we came to the conclusion that the structure was a composting area, because the of the amounf of leaves that were in the middle of the structure.
										</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/FloatingDoor.jpg" alt="Evidence of design with an absence of help" /></div>
										<p>In the theater, we found a door very high up near the ceiling. We named it the "Floating Door". This door looks like it leads to something,
											but there was no possible way for anyone to access the door. About 15 feet away from the door there was a ladder that looks like it can reach 
											the door. However, the ladder would need to be handled by at least two people, in order for the person to safely reach the door.
										</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/Photos.jpg" alt="Evidence of design for historical specificity" /></div>
										<p>In the business school, there is a wall of alumni from different ethnic backgrounds. Each photo showed what the alumnus were doing at the time.
										</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/GreenBox.jpg" alt="Evidence of design for environmental sustainability" /></div>
										<p>In the Usdan Student Center, there are boxes that allow students to know which bin they should put their trash in.
											I specifically, focused on Brandeis' "Green Boxes & bin". These green boxes were brought to Brandeis a few years ago
											and their purpose was to cut down on paper waste whenever students got food. The green boxes are reuseable, washable, and convenient.
										</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/Safety.jpg" alt="Evidence of design for health and well-being" /></div>
										<p>Within every building in Brandeis, there are safety kits that are meant to provide medical supplies in any sistuation.</p>
									</article>
									<article class="scavenger-card">
										<div class="scavenger-slot"><img src="images/Carger.jpg" alt="Evidence of design for ........" /></div>
										<p>Lastly, in Brandeis' busines school there are chargers mounted on the wall for people to be able to charger their phones,
											or any electronic device. I called this "Evidence of design for convenience". To me this serves multiple purposes, 
											1. having convenient chargering, and 2. a focus strategy since in-order to use the charger, you must leave your phone on the wall."
