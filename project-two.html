									<h1>Project Two<br />
									3D Printing Journey</h1>
									<p>This project showcases the process designing my 3D prints using two softwares, Tinkercad and Fusion.</p>

								<h2>Project Overview</h2>
								<p>This project represents my introduction to 3D printing technology. I started with simple designs and gradually worked my way up to more complex objects. The learning curve was steep, but the results were incredibly rewarding.</p>
								
								<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>3D Printer: [Your printer model]</li>
									<li>Design Software: [CAD software used]</li>
									<li>Slicing Software: [Slicer used]</li>
									<li>Materials: PLA, PETG, etc.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Process & Challenges</h2>

										<h3>Design Phase</h3>
										<p>For my flower pot, I started with a public 3D model from Thangs as my base design. Instead of creating the pot completely from scratch, I remixed it by making changes that improved both functionality and appearance. In Tinkercad, I added new small holes at the bottom of the pot to improve water drainage, while also filling in some of the existing holes that were too large. For a while, I had a hard time filling in the large hole because I was not able to make it flush with the existing base. After trying different methods I learned that making the shape fit as close as possible to the base then grouping the two shapes together, filled in the remaining space. This process gave me hands-on experience in modifying a design and how these modifications can directly affect the use of a design. 
Working in Tinkercad, I found the workflow very intuitive for this kind of remixing. Grouping and ungrouping solids and holes made it easy to test different drainage layouts. I tried different shapes for the new holes but ended up sticking with circles. Once the design was ready, I exported it and sliced it in PrusaSlicer. Using a 0.5 mm setting, I was able to print the pot within 3 hours.
This project showed me how remixing an existing model can still be a creative process, especially when adjusting features to add more functionality. By adding drainage holes and filling in others, I made the pot better for small succulents. In the end, the modified flower pot worked well for its purpose, and the process taught me how small changes in design can have a big impact on usability.

										<h3>Printing Phase</h3>
										<p>In Fusion, I translated sketches into precise models and began developing my Polaroid picture box. I started by creating a simple rectangle on a 2D plane, then extruded it to add depth and form a 3D solid. At first, this step was a bit frustrating because I thought something as basic as drawing and dimensioning a rectangle would be simple. Once the block was created, I used the Shell tool to hollow out the structure, transforming it into a functional container. One feature I attempted to incorporate was a narrow slot built into the top walls. I calculated the size of a Polaroid picture that could slide in and out with ease. I also learned to pay close attention to wall thickness, choosing 2 mm walls. Later, I moved the design into Tinkercad which allowed me to group solids and holes, and compare the differences between the two softwares,. This process taught me not only how to navigate Fusion more effectively, but also the importance of designing with patience and focus. After slicing it in PrusaSlicer, I experimented with some of the print settings. I changed the nozzle width and speed to 0.25mm Draft to see the difference between my 0.5mm flower pot. I saw that changing these settings lowered the print time by an hour or two.</p>

								<h2>Results & Learnings</h2>
								<p>Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>3D modeling and design principles</li>
									<li>Print settings optimization</li>
									<li>Material properties and selection</li>
									<li>Post-processing techniques</li>
									<li>Troubleshooting common printing issues</li>
								</ul>

								<blockquote>
									"Every failed print was a step closer to understanding the intricate balance between design, material, and machine settings that makes 3D printing both challenging and rewarding."
								</blockquote>

								<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
								<p>Moving forward, I plan to explore more advanced printing techniques, experiment with different materials, and tackle more complex multi-part assemblies. This project laid the foundation for my ongoing journey in additive manufacturing.</p>
