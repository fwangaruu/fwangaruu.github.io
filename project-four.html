									<h1>Project Four<br />
									3D Printing Journey</h1>
									<p>This project showcases my process of designing and refining a functional 3D-printed bottle cap using Fusion 360, focusing on parametric modeling, threading techniques, and print optimization.</p>

								<h2>Project Overview</h2>
								<p>For project four, I designed and 3D-printed a parameter-based bottle cap that can be customized for any container. The goal was to create a solution for the common problem of pump bottles leaving a significant amount of product at the bottom or on the sides, forcing users to cut open or discard partially filled bottles. My design aims to replace those pump caps with a reusable screw-top lid that can fit almost any bottle through adjustable parameters in Fusion 360.</p>
								
								<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>3D Printer: Prusa Mini</li>
									<li>Design Software: Fusion</li>
									<li>Slicing Software: PrusaSlicer</li>
									<li>Materials: PLA.</li>
								</ul>

										<h3>Design</h3>
										<p>Once the radio was built, I began the main part of the project, designing and constructing a custom 3D-printed enclosure for the radio. My initial base model was created in Fusion 360, but I encountered a few issues with software and continued to deal with the learning curve. To simplify the design process, I transferred my work to TinkerCad, where I continued the design process and adjusted for the measurements of the radio. After many tries, I learned that dimensions and scaling don’t always translate consistently between different software programs, which led to some misalignments in my prototype.
This project showed me how remixing an existing model can still be a creative process and that you still need attention to details, especially when adjusting features to add more functionality. By adding drainage holes and filling in others, I made the pot better for small succulents. In the end, the modified flower pot worked well for its purpose, and the process taught me how small changes in design can have a big impact on usability.

										<h3></h3>
										<p>I began by modeling a simple cylinder cap and cutting a center hole to form the basic geometry. Next, I started to do my research in threading specifically thread pitch, major and minor diameters, and tolerance. 
											I took physical measurements from several examples, such as the in-class hand sanitizer cap and my personal lotion bottle. 
											My measurements for my lotion bottle were: major diameter of 24.20 mm, a minor diameter of 22 mm, a pitch of 2.60 mm, and an inside lid height of 10 mm. 
											After collecting these measurements, I started using the thread feature in Fusion 360 but realized that it was difficult to customize. 
											I tried a few prints with the threads but with more research, I found that a lot of people prefer using the coil feature to model threads, because of its flexibility and control. 
											When I made the switch to use coils instead of threads I noticed a difference with my final print. To optimize print quality, I set the print orientation upside-down in PrusaSlicer to avoid unnecessary supports. 
											After noticing that supports caused webbing and clogging between the threads our TA Avery, taught me that not all prints required supports and that if we change the printing face we can possibly remove supports. 
											So I rotated my model 180 degrees which removed the need for supports but also reduced print time. 
											The final print fit securely on my lotion bottle and demonstrated a repeatable, adjustable model that others could use by simply changing key parameters such as pitch, major and minor diameter, and height.

								<h2>Results & Learnings</h2>
								<p>Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>3D modeling and design principles</li>
									<li>Print settings optimization</li>
									<li>Material properties and selection</li>
									<li>Post-processing techniques</li>
									<li>Troubleshooting common printing issues</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
								<p>This project taught me a lot about functional design, tolerances, and 3D-printing efficiency. I successfully created a customizable model that solves a real world problem, and I gained confidence in measuring and applying threading parameters. Throughout the process, I learned the difference between the thread and coil tools in Fusion 360.
